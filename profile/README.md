# WakeyWakey 


We plan to develop a smart-sleep tracking system that wake users up during light sleep to reduce grogginess and boost alertness. 

## Components

### Hardware
We plan on creating a proprietary wearable that will measure the following:
- Heart rate
- Movement


### Mobile App
The mobile app will serve the following purposes:
- Calculate sleep patterns based on data collected by the wearable.
- Display sleep data and metrics
- Set alarms

### Backend
The backend will have the following:
- Cloud database for storage of anonymized user metrics
- API to read and write data.
